# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time PDF preview functionality for FeynmanCraft ADK, integrating LaTeX compilation results into the React frontend interface. The system will automatically compile generated TikZ code to PDF and display it in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback to users and enhancing the overall user experience for physics diagram generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a physics researcher, I want to see a real-time PDF preview of my generated Feynman diagram, so that I can immediately verify the visual output without manual compilation steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates TikZ code from user input THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger LaTeX compilation within 1 second
2. WHEN LaTeX compilation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the PDF preview in the frontend interface within 3 seconds total
3. WHEN the user modifies the physics process description THEN the system SHALL update the PDF preview automatically without manual refresh
4. IF the TikZ code is valid THEN the system SHALL render a high-quality PDF preview with proper scaling and formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a physics educator, I want clear error messages when LaTeX compilation fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix diagram generation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LaTeX compilation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with specific details
2. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide suggested fixes based on common LaTeX/TikZ issues
3. IF the error is related to missing packages THEN the system SHALL indicate which packages need to be installed
4. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize and display the most critical error first

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an academic paper author, I want to download the generated diagram in multiple formats, so that I can use it in different publication contexts and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PDF preview is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL provide a download button for PDF format
2. WHEN the user requests alternative formats THEN the system SHALL support SVG and PNG export options
3. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames based on the physics process described
4. IF the user selects PNG format THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options (300dpi, 600dpi, 1200dpi)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a graduate student, I want the PDF preview to work with complex diagrams and different LaTeX packages, so that I can create sophisticated physics visualizations without technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diagram uses advanced TikZ-Feynman features THEN the system SHALL compile successfully with all required packages
2. WHEN the diagram contains multiple interaction vertices THEN the system SHALL render all components clearly in the preview
3. IF the diagram requires specific LaTeX packages THEN the system SHALL automatically include necessary package imports
4. WHEN the diagram is complex THEN the system SHALL maintain compilation time under 5 seconds for 95% of cases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the PDF generation to be robust and handle edge cases gracefully, so that the system remains stable under various usage conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LaTeX compilation takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully with an appropriate message
2. WHEN multiple users generate PDFs simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without performance degradation
3. IF system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL queue compilation requests and provide status updates
4. WHEN temporary files are created during compilation THEN the system SHALL clean up resources automatically after completion
